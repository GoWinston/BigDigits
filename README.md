# The Big Board

This is an Arduino powered system to allow the construction of giant seven segment displays, up to 50V 0.5A per segment.

The library workes with any Arduino using the SPI protocol, allowing a 4 digit display (32 segements) to be remotely connected via a single ethernet cable.

Two PCB designs are included, one with four digits on one board and another with a single digit per board.  

The hardware and library support four channels.

The power for the big displays goes directly into the PCBs and is seperate from the logic power on the Arduino which travels over the ethernet cable<br>

Power each segement from V+ --> LED segment lights --> Control Board <br>
